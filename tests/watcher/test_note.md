- Content is properly parsed and indexed
- All metadata is correctly extracted

## Test Content

Here's some sample content with **bold text** and *italic text* to ensure markdown parsing works correctly.

### Code Block

```python
def test_function():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

### List Example

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

- Bullet point one
- Bullet point two

## Conclusion

This test file should be properly indexed by the file watcher system.
