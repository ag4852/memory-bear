# Modified Test Note for File Watcher

This is a **modified** test note to verify that the file watcher properly detects and indexes file changes.

## Updated Content

The original content has been completely replaced with this new content to test the modification workflow.

## Features Tested
- File modification detection
- Content re-indexing
- Timestamp updates
- Metadata refresh

## Additional Information

This template represents the state of the file after modification, allowing us to test that:
1. The file watcher detects the change
2. The content is re-parsed and re-indexed
3. All metadata is properly updated
4. Timestamps reflect the modification time

The modification test ensures our system properly handles file updates in real-time.
